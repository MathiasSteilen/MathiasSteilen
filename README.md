### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate statistics student at ETH Zurich with an undergrad in Economics/Finance from the University of St.Gallen.
I am passionate about machine learning applications for prediction making and more recently: Reinforcement Learning. The latter I have collected experience in during my internship at BKW (Energy) in Asset Optimisation and Operations Research for flexible powerplants.

I have previous experience in **Python** (`pandas`, `PyTorch`, `Stable-Baselines3`, `RayTune`, `RLlib`...), **R** (`Tidyverse`, `Tidymodels`...), **VBA** and **SQL**. You can find some of my projects on machine learning and data visualisation [on my personal website](https://mathiassteilen.github.io/), as well as in my [52 weeks of Python and R in 2023 challenge repo](https://github.com/MathiasSteilen/52-Weeks-of-Python-and-R-2023).

Feel free to connect and reach out, I am always on the look-out for interesting ideas and projects!
