### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate finance student with an interest in machine learning applications for prediction making. 
I have previous experience in **R**, **Python**, **VBA** and **SQL**. You can find some of my projects machine learning and data visualisation [on my personal website](https://mathiassteilen.github.io/), which I have created during the second half of 2022. This year (2023), I have set myself the challenge of doing one modelling/wrangling/visualisation project each week for the whole year in both Python and R, which you can [check out here](https://github.com/MathiasSteilen/52-Weeks-of-Python-and-R-2023).
