### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a MSc Statistics candidate at ETH Zurich with an undergrad in Economics/Finance from the University of St.Gallen.
I am passionate about machine learning applications and quantitative methods for decision making in a business context. In my role as Spot Power Analyst at Axpo, I am gaining experience in power trading, price forecasting and market analysis.

I have previous experience in **Python** (`pandas`, `polars`, `PyTorch`, `sklearn`, `Stable-Baselines3`, `RayTune`, `RLlib`...), **R** (`Base`,`Tidyverse`, `Tidymodels`...), **VBA** and **SQL**. You can find some of my projects on machine learning and data visualisation [on my personal website](https://mathiassteilen.github.io/), as well as in the GitHub highlights right below this text.

Feel free to connect and reach out, I am always working on and looking for interesting projects and inspirations!
