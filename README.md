### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate finance student with an interest in machine learning applications for prediction making. 
I have previous experience in **R**, **Python**, **VBA** and **SQL**. You can find some of my work on machine learning and data visualisation on my personal website, which I have created over the second half of 2022: [![Markdown Badge](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/510a057988cb5216f5d297ee202f6a08fa179798926cea28e95910f6b8ca5535/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f4d61726b646f776e2d3030303030303f7374796c653d666f722d7468652d6261646765266c6f676f3d6d61726b646f776e266c6f676f436f6c6f723d7768697465)](https://mathiassteilen.github.io/). This year (2023), I am doing one small modelling/wrangling/visualisation project each week for the whole year in both Python and R, which you can [check out here](https://github.com/MathiasSteilen/52-Weeks-of-Python-and-R-2023).
